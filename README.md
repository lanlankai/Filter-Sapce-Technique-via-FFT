# Filter-Sapce-Technique-via-FFT
This Python implementation of the Filter-Space Technique efficiently calculates energy/enstrophy flux on the Earth's surface. Leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for convolution with a Gaussian kernel significantly boosts performance. Stay tuned for the package upload after final cleanup!

The Julia version is coming soon after test.
